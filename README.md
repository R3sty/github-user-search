## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

First, I looked at the Figma design and started with the basic layout.
Next, I moved on to creating components and then added the necessary logic.

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite JS](https://vitejs.dev/) - React framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Throughout the development process, I learned:

It's important to start with the logic first before creating components.
How to configure a dark mode feature.
How to use React Hooks to improve the functionality of the app.
The syntax for Typescript.
How to integrate ChatGPT into my project.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I plan to continue learning and experimenting with different React Hooks to further improve my projects.
